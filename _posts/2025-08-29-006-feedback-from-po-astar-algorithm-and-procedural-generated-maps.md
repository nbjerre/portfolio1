## What have I worked on this week?

This week we had a meeting with the PO. I got stuck with weapon upgrades, so I moved on to something the PO suggested, namely an algorithm for our enemies so they avoid obstacles. After that, I started working on procedurally generating the map.

## What have I learned?

*A* algorithm, a popular algorithm within pathfinding, as well as started on procedural generation.

## What challenges did I face?

*I thought weapon upgrades became too complicated, and perhaps at too early a stage to work more on. Implementing the A* algorithm in script was also complicated, but in Godot there was a node that could be used for the algorithm, which helped.

## How have I contributed to the project?

W﻿eapon upgrades, enemy pathfinding

## Machine Learning and AI:

N﻿o progress, still waiting for a simple copy of the game, everything is researched to begin experimenting

## Next steps / focus for next week

P﻿rocedural map, with grass,roads,and trees for now.

## Reflection

L﻿ooking forward to begin with machine learning, alot of progress is made on the project, and alot of different things has allready been made.
