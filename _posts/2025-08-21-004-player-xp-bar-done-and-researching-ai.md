### P﻿roduct and G﻿uild Gamedev:

A﻿s you can see on the kanban board alot of progress has been made the first week, alot of it is basic stuff and just settings things up, almost everything is certainly going to be change again. latest thing i made was a xp bar, so the dropped xp can be picked up, currently it does nothing more than add color to the bar, next up i will try to make  a form of currency for the player.

### Guild ML and AI:

I﻿ am researching and watching videos about what a neural net is, i will continue to do so another week, then find out what i need to the make a ai play our game
