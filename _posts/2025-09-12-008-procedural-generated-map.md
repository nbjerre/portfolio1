## Focus from last week

P﻿rocedural map, with grass,roads,and trees for now.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")

**This week, I have been working on procedurally generating the game map.**\
To achieve this, I wrote the code in **GDScript**, as the documentation and available resources for it were more extensive and easier to work with compared to other options.

In addition to the coding side, I also created **new assets for the map**, which helped improve its overall look and feel. At this stage, the procedural map generation is functional, and the **player now spawns correctly at the house**, which serves as the initial starting point.

This has given me a solid foundation to continue building on, as the map system is now dynamic and can be further expanded with new features.

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

**I have learned more about the key factors that influence procedural generation.**\
For example, I gained a deeper understanding of **which types of noise functions are most suitable** for different purposes, and I explored several **algorithms for generating road systems** within a procedurally created map.

In addition, I discovered a helpful online tool that makes it easier to **adjust and prepare assets for Godot’s terrain system**. This has streamlined my workflow and allowed me to integrate assets more smoothly into the environment.

Overall, this week has not only advanced the project technically but also strengthened my knowledge of procedural generation techniques and practical asset management in Godot.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

**One of the main challenges this week was fine-tuning the generated map.**\
It took considerable time to adjust details such as **the number of trees to spawn**, **the layout of the road system**, and other balancing aspects that make the environment feel natural and believable. While working with **GDScript itself was relatively straightforward**, most of the week was spent on careful adjustments and testing.

I also encountered some issues with my **custom assets**, particularly in relation to **Godot’s terrain system**. These challenges slowed down progress at first, but I eventually found a very useful website that helped resolve many of the problems. The link to this resource can be found below.

Overall, the week involved a lot of iteration and problem-solving, but it also gave me a stronger understanding of both the technical and design-related aspects of procedural generation.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

I have now completed version 1.0 of the procedurally generated map and pushed it to the main branch.

## Machine Learning and AI:[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#machine-learning-and-ai "Permalink")

**I dedicated an entire day to training the AI model, and progress is moving forward gradually.**\
Working with machine learning has shown me how important it is to be careful when making adjustments. There are many complex concepts to understand, and changing parameters without knowing their exact effect can easily lead to unintended results. Similarly, modifying several settings at once makes it difficult to track which change caused which outcome.

In general, **machine learning requires patience and time**, as the training process is inherently slow. One possible optimization I considered was running **multiple instances of the game in parallel**, which would allow the AI to gather experience more quickly. However, this approach would also require **script modifications** to support parallel training, so it is something I will need to plan carefully before implementing.

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

This will require some careful consideration, as I need to think through how the system should be structured and how it will integrate with the rest of the game. Part of this process will involve looking into which **systems development artifacts** can be applied to support the design, such as diagrams, models, or structured documentation.

The goal is to create a clear foundation before starting implementation, ensuring that the upgrade system is both scalable and flexible enough to support future additions.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")

I have learned a great deal about **procedural generation**, both in theory and in practice, and these new insights have directly contributed to progress on the project. It feels rewarding to see the results take shape, and the knowledge gained this week will serve as a strong foundation for the next stages of development.
