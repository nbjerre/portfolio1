## Focus from last week

P﻿rocedural map, with grass,roads,and trees for now.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")

I﻿ worked one day on the Procedural generated map, but pivoted to my Machine Learning subject, because the game was now at a stage where i could work on machine learning

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I have learned about implementing machine learning agents, how to set it up in Godot, and how to connect it from the Python script.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

It is difficult to keep track of all the new concepts in machine learning — epsilon, gamma, states, single and improved net, buffer size, LR, epsilon decay. I think the next challenge will be to make it learn and adjust all of this.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

One small update to the procedural gen map, instead i have used my time on ML

## Machine Learning and AI:[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#machine-learning-and-ai "Permalink")

alot of progress has been made, i am in the stage of getting the AI to talk to the game, and setting up how it should learn, a good week for ML

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

P﻿rocedural map, with grass,roads,and trees for now.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")

L﻿ooking forward to begin with machine learning, alot of progress is made on the project, and alot of different things has allready been made.
