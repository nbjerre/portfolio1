Over the course of building this portfolio, I have come to see this site as more than just a collection of technical log entries. It is mygrowth and understanding.

### What I’ve Learned, My Progress Over Time

* **Iteration and balance**: Whether gamemechanics, sound design, or AI logic. Over time, I’ve learned to approach balance as a dynamic process, not a fixed goal. I’ve become more comfortable revisiting and refining earlier work rather than aiming for “finished” results.
* **Integration of systems (sound, AI, gameplay)**: I see clear progression in how I combine different systems, sound effects, spawning logic, gameplay balance, treating them not as isolated pieces but as parts of a  experience. I’m not just building components, I’m building a world.
* **Reflecting on process, not just product**: The portfolio has forced me to slow down, note what works and what doesn’t. This act of documenting, even the “bad” parts, has become a tool for growth, helping me learn from mistakes and rethink strategies.

### Challenges & What I Realised

While building this portfolio and writing about my work:

* I sometimes felt the urge to only present “finished”, polished code, balanced gameplay. But I realise now how valuable the messy, entries are: they show growth and learning.
* It’s easy to drift into doing tasks without reflecting. The disciplined act of posting documentation forced me to pause, think *why* I made certain decisions.

### What I Want to Carry Forward

Looking ahead, I want to:

* If p﻿ossible using the portfolio as both a technical log *and* a reflection space, documenting both successes and failures, insights and doubts.
* Use what I learn here to build more coherent, polished, and thoughtful projects
* Occasionally step back and reflect on *my overall development*.
