### P﻿roduct and G﻿uild Gamedev:

###### Progress:

I﻿t tooke some time to make the xpbar correctly so when the player levels up it resets, i also got sidetracked with using a shader for the grass(linked below), it was supposed to make it less repeatable, but my knowledge about shaders and materials was to small, so i dropped it and continued to work on the xp bar. as you can see in the photo, i am making progress, the bar now resets and you can choose between fire and ice arrow, i have alot more to understand about spawning objects, not even begun to look at animation.

###### N﻿ext:

finetune and add a style to the buttons, aswell as fixing a bug we found in our playtesting, where it does not change who the arrow flies at.

### Guild ML and AI:

###### Progress:

s﻿till researching and watching videos about what a neural net is. i understand there is a weight to the different nodes, and a form of randomness that needs to happen when i tweak it. im pretty sure i will use pytorch as a machine learning model.\
\
a﻿lso i am overwhelmed by all the different names the ai have, neural net, deep learning, q learning, machine learning. im not really sure what my idea fits under

###### N﻿ext:

I will continue to do so another week, then find out what i need to the make pytorch play our game
