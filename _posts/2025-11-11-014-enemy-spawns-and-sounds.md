## Focus from last week

Next week, I’ll continue working on balancing everything and finishing up the remaining sounds. Balancing takes a lot of time, but it’s an important step to make the gameplay feel right.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")

Sounds and balancing, and finished with my machine learning side project

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I’ve learned about different aspects of sound design, such as using layers, volume balancing, and timing to create a more immersive experience. I also experimented with how sound cues can support gameplay feedback and player awareness.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

I realized that we didn’t fully apply some of the basic principles of object-oriented programming early on. Because of that, the project has become a bit harder to keep structured and maintainable. It’s a good reminder of how important clean architecture and reusable code are, especially as a project grows.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

I’ve more or less finished the sound design for now, but balancing continues to be a never-ending process. Every small change affects the overall gameplay feel, so it’s something that constantly needs fine-tuning.

## Machine Learning and AI:[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#machine-learning-and-ai "Permalink")

This week I experimented with AI and managed to successfully train a neural network using reinforcement learning and Deep Q-Learning. The agent was able to play a simplified version of the game and learned to avoid enemies through trial and error. Watching the AI improve over time and develop basic survival strategies was a really interesting experience.

i﻿ have put the project up on github:

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

Next week, my main focus will be on creating artifacts and cleaning up the codebase. The project has grown quite a lot over time, and it’s starting to show in the structure. I want to reorganize scripts, remove unnecessary parts, and make everything more readable and maintainable. Alongside that, I’ll start implementing artifact functionality to give players new ways to progress and customize their playstyle. It’s a step toward polishing the final gameplay experience and preparing the project for a more stable version.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")

I’m really happy to have finished the machine learning part of the project. It’s now at a point where it could even be used as promotional material for the game on social media, if we get that far. Development has slowed down a bit lately due to my internship search, but I’m still making steady progress whenever I get the chance.
