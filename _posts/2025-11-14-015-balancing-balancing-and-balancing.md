## Focus from last week

Next week, my main focus will be on creating artifacts and cleaning up the codebase. The project has grown quite a lot over time, and it’s starting to show in the structure. I want to reorganize scripts, remove unnecessary parts, and make everything more readable and maintainable. Alongside that, I’ll start implementing artifact functionality to give players new ways to progress and customize their playstyle. It’s a step toward polishing the final gameplay experience and preparing the project for a more stable version.
