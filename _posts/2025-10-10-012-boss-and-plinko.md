## Focus from last week

Next week, my main goal is to create a tree boss. This will be the first larger enemy encounter, and I’m excited to design its abilities and mechanics to make it feel like a real challenge.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")

<!--StartFragment-->

This week I focused on creating a boss character. He now has three abilities, which are illustrated in red. Everything works mechanically, though the visuals are still quite rough — but that’s not my main priority right now.

After finishing the boss logic, I started working on a *Plinko* feature that appears when the player dies. The goal is to keep the player engaged even after losing, by adding a fun and interactive element to the death sequence.

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I’ve learned more about coding and how to structure a boss fight, including how different attack patterns and behaviors can be designed. I also experimented with some animations and simple drawing algorithms, which gave me a better understanding of how visuals and logic can work together.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

There weren’t any major challenges this week, but there were quite a few small ones along the way.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

I’ve added a new boss with three abilities, as well as a Plinko feature that appears when the player dies to make the experience more engaging.

No progress has been made

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

My focus for next week will be to make enemies spawn consistently throughout the entire 15-minute gameplay session. It’s vacation next week, so we’ll see how much I actually manage to get done.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")

It’s been a good and stable week. I think we’re getting close to being done with adding new features, and it’s time to start focusing on making everything work smoothly together.
