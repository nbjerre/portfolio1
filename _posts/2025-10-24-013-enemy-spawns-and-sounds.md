## Focus from last week

My focus for next week will be to make enemies spawn consistently throughout the entire 15-minute gameplay session. It’s vacation next week, so we’ll see how much I actually manage to get done.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")

It’s been vacation time, but I still managed to make some solid progress. I got enemies to spawn consistently over a 15-minute period, and I’ve also started working on adding sounds to the game, which is already making it feel much more alive.

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I’ve learned some theory about sound design in games and how different audio elements can enhance the player’s experience. I also gained a better understanding of how to balance difficulty to make the gameplay feel fair and engaging.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

I’ve realized that testing things like enemy spawns takes a lot more time than I expected. I definitely underestimated how long it takes to properly balance a game — adjusting character speed, enemy health, damage values, and even sound levels. Every small tweak affects the overall gameplay feel, so it’s a slow but important process.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

I’ve made the game fully playable for a 15-minute session and added sound effects to enhance the overall experience.

No progress has been made

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

Next week, I’ll continue working on balancing everything and finishing up the remaining sounds. Balancing takes a lot of time, but it’s an important step to make the gameplay feel right.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")

The first week of polishing has gone well. It hasn’t been as fun as creating new features, but it’s a very important part of the process to make everything feel complete and polished.
