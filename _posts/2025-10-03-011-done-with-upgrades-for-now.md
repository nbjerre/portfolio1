## Focus from last week

Next week, my main focus will be on creating several new weapon abilities. Expanding the ability pool will not only add more variety to the combat but also make each run feel more unique and replayable.

## What have I worked on this week?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-worked-on-this-week "Permalink")



This week I added everything you can see in the screenshot, including two new combo abilities as well as some animations to bring them to life. It’s been exciting to see the gameplay start to feel more dynamic as abilities and visuals come together.

## What have I learned?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")



I’ve learned that it’s really important to keep track of all upgrades in a clear and organized way. Without a proper system, things can quickly become overwhelming and difficult to manage.

## What challenges did I face?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

There haven’t really been any major challenges this week. The development went smoothly, and I was able to focus on adding new content without running into big issues.

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")



I’ve added the upgrades shown in the picture, expanding the gameplay options and making progression feel more rewarding.

No progress has been made

## Next steps / focus for next week[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#next-steps--focus-for-next-week "Permalink")

Next week, my main goal is to create a tree boss. This will be the first larger enemy encounter, and I’m excited to design its abilities and mechanics to make it feel like a real challenge.

## Reflection[](https://portfolionbjerre.netlify.app/006-feedback-from-po-astar-algorithm-and-procedural-generated-maps/#reflection "Permalink")



I didn’t have too much to write about this week, since most of the work was just a continuation of what I started last week. There weren’t many new developments or major challenges to highlight.
